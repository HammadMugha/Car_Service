              <p>
                You understand that all information, data, text, software,
                music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags, or
                other materials (“Content“), whether publicly posted or

                from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not
                Payrib, are entirely responsible for all Content that you
                upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via
                the Services. Payrib does not control the Content posted via the
                Services and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy,
                integrity or quality of such Content. You understand that by
                using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that is
                offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances
                will Payrib be liable in any way for any Content, including, but
                not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any
                loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of
                any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made
                available via the Services. You acknowledge that Payrib may or
                may not pre-screen Content, but that Payrib and its designees
                shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole
                discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Content that is
                available via the Services. Without limiting the foregoing,
                Payrib and its designees shall have the right to remove any
                Content that violates the Terms or is otherwise objectionable.
                You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated
                with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the
                accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this
                regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content
                created by Payrib or submitted to Payrib, including without
                limitation information in Payrib Message Boards and in all other

                Payrib may access, preserve and disclose your account
                information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good
                faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is
                reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii)
                enforce the Terms; (iii) respond to claims that any Content
                violates the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your
                requests for customer service; or (v) protect the rights,

                You understand that the Services and software embodied within
                the Services may include security components that permit digital
                materials to be protected, and that use of these materials is
                subject to usage rules set by Payrib and/or content providers

                Payrib does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make
                available for inclusion on the Services. However, with respect
                to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on

                Content on the Services solely for the purposes of providing and
                promoting the services. This license exists only for as long as
                you elect to continue to include such Content on the Services
                and will terminate at the time you remove or Payrib removes such
                Content from the Services.

              <h2>3.1. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICY</h2>
              <p>
                Payrib is committed to protecting copyrights and expects users
                of the Service to do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright
                Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners
                who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes
                their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good
                faith that any material used or displayed on or through the
                Service infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send
                us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access
                to it blocked. The notice must include the following
                information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person
                authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right
                that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the
                copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple
                copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a
                representative list of such works); (c) identification of the
                material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of
                infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to
                allow us to locate the material on the Service; (d) the name,
                address, telephone number and email address (if available) of
                the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining
                party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the
                manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner,
                its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information
                in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury,
                that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the
                owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you
                believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement
                has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send
                us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the
                then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see
                http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. DMCA notices and
                counter-notices regarding the Service should be sent to Payrib
                Contact Email. Indemnification You agree to indemnify, defend
                and hold us, our affiliates, distributors, partners, licensors,
                advertisers and sponsors, and our and their directors, officers,

                costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) and other expenses
                that arise directly or indirectly out of or from (a) your breach
                of these Terms; (b) your Content submissions; and/or (c) your
                activities in connection with the Services (including, without
                limitation, any and all purchases).

              <p>
                Many of our customers are interested in submitting ideas and
                suggestions for products and services to be used at Payrib,
                either independently of, or in conjunction with, our internally
                developed concepts. We appreciate our customers’ interest in
                improving the Services; however, please note that any such ideas
                or suggestions that you submit will be owned by Payrib, and you
                hereby irrevocably assign any intellectual property rights in
                such ideas and suggestions to Payrib. In the event that the
                foregoing assignment is held to be ineffective for any reason,
                your ideas and suggestions will be treated as Content

                If you intend to retain any intellectual property rights in your
                ideas and suggestions (patent, trade secrets, copyright,
                trademark, etc.), please do not submit them to us without our
